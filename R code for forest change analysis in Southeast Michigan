# Forest change analysis for Southeast Michigan region

# The objective of this project is to analyze the forest cover change in Southeast Michigan for the last thirty years
# The analysis was conducted for 131 minor divisions (Townships and Cities) in Southeast Michigan (SEM).
# I inherited metrics of forest fragmentation from Landscape Metrics developed by Kevin McGarigal
# I used a remotely sensed forest cover data for the year 1985, 2005, and 2015 to conduct the analysis
# However, the challenge was ordinary computers do not have sufficient memory to process this big dataset at once
# Given the volume of data to be processed, I chose to partition the entire landscape of SEM by the boundary of each minor divisions
# I conducted the analysis for each minor division and then merged the final results to produce one big metrics
# SEM - refers to Southeast Michigan and md - refers to minor divisions

# Below are some of the R packages I used for my analysis
library(sf)
library(landscapemetrics)

# upload a shapefile containing boundaries of each md and counties in SEM
divisions <- as_Spatial(st_transform(st_read("D:/Detroit project/New folder/minor_divisions.shp")
                     , crs = 4326))
